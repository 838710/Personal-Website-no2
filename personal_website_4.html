                    <p>...of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis 
                        was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... 
                        He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the 
                        Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of 
                        was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then 
                        his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

                    <p>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, 
                        master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my 
                        brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to 
                        learn before he's ready to save anyone. *OOF* But I believe Aang can save the world.

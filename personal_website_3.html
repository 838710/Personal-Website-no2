                <br><h2>Jiu-Jitsu</h2>
                <div class="row">
                    <a><img src="images/bjj.png"></a>
                    <p>I started doing Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu when I was in 8th grade. I stopped during 9th grade due to the pandemic, but I was on my way to
                        becoming a blue belt. My brother and I still spar sometimes (he and I went to the gym together), so I haven't entirely stopped. I'm not
                        doing it as much as I was previously, though.<br>
                        The picture on the left was taken at a seminar hosted by Grand Master Relson Gracie, when I had only been doing it for a few months. 
                        As you can tell, I am extremely unphotogenic.

                <br><h2>Robotics:</h2>
                <div class="row">
                    <a><img src="https://www.team5338.org/files/468.jpg"></a>
                    <p>I'm also a member of the FIRST Robotics team RoboLoCo, 5338. We basically build a robot in 6 weeks to play in a game made of a bunch 
                        of different obstacles and challenges. While the upperclassmen tend to do the heavy lifting, that doesn't mean that we underclassmen
                        are useless. What I mostly helped out with (aside from menial labor and cleaning up after meetings) was electrical work - cutting wires,
                        crimping connectors, and some soldering once in a while.<br>
                        The picture to the left was taken at the only competition we were able to go to during the 2019-2020 season, before it was cut short
                        prematurely by the pandemic. As you can tell, it was quite hype.

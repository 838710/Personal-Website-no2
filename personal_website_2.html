                <h1>(New) Hobbies:</h1>
                <p>Well, I'm running out of ideas quick. I mean, I could just copy paste the stuff I put on my previous portfolio onto this one, but that just
                    feels cheap. So, why don't I just write a little summary of the new hobbies I've accrued?

                <br><h2>Minesweeper:</h2>
                <div class="row">
                    <a href="http://minesweeperonline.com/"><img src="images/minesweeper.PNG"></a>
                    <p>I've taken to playing lots of minesweeper recently. The picture on the right is of the minesweeperonline version, but I tend to switch 
                        between the Google version as well, depending on how I'm feeling. Oddly enough, while having a higher mine density (99 mines in a 
                        smaller area than the minesweeperonline version), it feels easier. Maybe the Google version checks if the game is possible? Running 
                        into a dead end is pretty common for me on the minesweeperonline version. Or maybe I'm just bad.

                <br><h2>Bloons:</h2>
                <div class="row">
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BTDIsab"><img src="images/ISAB.jpg"></a>
                    <p>Added to my collection of "what I like to watch on YouTube" is Bloons Tower Defense 6. As you know, I used to (and still do) love 
                        playing Flash games, and BTD was one of my favorites. I don't play BTD6 as A) I'm broke and B) I don't have a phone to download the
                        mobile version on, but watching it is still entertaining. One of my favorite BTD6 YouTubers to watch is ISAB, but Superjombombo and 
                        Aliensrock are cool too. On the left is ISAB's logo.

                    <a><img src="images/scp.png"></a>
                    <p>The SCP community is a really cool place, filled with a lot of talented people. I do love a good story, and some of the stuff the 
                        community churns out really gets the gears turning. My personal favorites include SCP-5000, SCP-049 vs. SCP-096, 
                        and When Day Breaks in SCP-3008. I don't really browse the wiki, rather just watch people on YouTube who tell the stories. My favorites
                        include Dr. Cimmerian, SCP Illustrated, TheVolgun, The Exploring Series, and Dr. Bob. <br>

                        Nor is 'More Chainsaws'.
                        
                        Or 'Chainsaw cannons'.
                        
                        Except for that one time. And yes, it was awesome."
